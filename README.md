[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kirbyfan64/mathworks.png)](https://travis-ci.org/kirbyfan64/mathworks)

A simple Python math library. Downloads at https://sourceforge.net/projects/mathworks/. I am working on documentation, see http://mathworks.sourceforge.net/index.html.

Version history:

1.0: Wrote it in \__init__.py as 0.1.0, but then I realized that it was stable enough. Anyway, this is the first version. Date: 4/19/2013

1.1: Added use of math.py's math.pi to get pi if available. Added area function. Date: 4/20/13

1.1.1. Fixed Syntax Error in shapes.py. I put an else instead of except. :) Date: 4/20/13

1.2: Added ptheorem.py. No examples yet. Also, changed backround code in shapes.py. Date: 4/21/13

1.3: Changed license to Boost Software License. Added area of a triangle. Added ability to get leg value in ptheorem.py. Date: 4/22/13

1.3.1: Added cuberoot function to exponent.py. Date: 5/27/13

1.3.2: Fixed some bugs. Date: 6/6/13

1.4.0: Major fixer-upper. Added setup script, unit tests, and cleaned up a bunch of stuff. Date: 11/19/13

Note: The C++ version HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED!!! The Ruby version has been backed up for a while...

Documentation(still in progress!): http://mathworks.sourceforge.net/index.html

Coming soon:

- 3D figures in a new file called 3d_shapes.py

- Add factoring
