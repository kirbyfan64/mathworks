mathworks
=========

A simple Python math library. There is no documentation yet, but there will be soon.

Version history:

1.0: Wrote it in __init__.py as 0.1.0, but then I realized that it was stable enough. Anyway, this is the first version. Date: 4/19/2013

1.1: Added use of math.py's math.pi to get pi if available. Added area function. Date: 4/20/13

1.1.1: Fixed Syntax Error in shapes.py. I put an else instead of except. :) Date: 4/20/13

Coming soon:

-3D figures in a new file called 3d_shapes.py

-Addition of the Pythagorean Theorem in ptheorem.py

-Probably more stuff, just can't think of things right now
